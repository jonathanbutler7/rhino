# What is this project?

**A take home coding challenge for a junior site developer role in which I was required to web scrape using [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/).**

## The requirements were:

1. Create a new node project and run `npm install puppeteer`
2. Create a new file called `rhino.js` to work in
3. In this file launch a new puppeteer browser and go to: `https://www.rhino.com/user/login`
4. Login to the site with these credentials: `username` `password`
5. Once login is complete go to to this page (which you can only view logged in): `testurl`
6. Grab the text from inside the `<div>` with this id:`textToScrape`
7. Save the text you grabbed to a local text file named: `scraped.txt`
<<<<<<< HEAD
8. Zip up *just* `rhino.js` and send via email

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `node rhino.js`
